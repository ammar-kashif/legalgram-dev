Leased Property.
The Landlord hereby leases to the Tenant the located at ${answers.property_address || '________'}, ${answers.property_city || '________'}, Arkansas ${answers.property_zip || '________'} ("Leased Property").

Term.
This Lease shall be for a fixed term, starting on ${answers.lease_start || '________'} ("Start Date") and ending on ${answers.lease_end || '________'} ("Termination Date"). The Tenant will be entitled to possession of the Leased Property beginning on the Start Date and shall maintain possession of the Leased Property until the Termination Date unless terminated through approved methods outlined in this Lease or under Arkansas law.

Rent.
The Tenant agrees to pay to the Landlord as rent for the use and occupancy of the Leased Property the sum of $${answers.rent_amount || '________'} due on the first day of each month ("Rent").
The Rent shall be paid by the following method(s): ${answers.payment_method || '________'}
The Rent shall be payable to the Landlord, located at ${answers.landlord_address || '________'}.
The Landlord can be reached by phone at ${answers.landlord_phone || '________'} or by email at ${answers.landlord_email || '________'}.
If any payment is returned for non-sufficient funds or because the Tenant stops payments, then, after that, the Landlord may, in writing, require the Tenant to pay future Rent payments by cash, cashier's check, or money order.

Security Deposit.
At the time of the signing of this Lease, the Tenant shall pay to the Landlord, in trust, a security deposit of $${answers.security_deposit || '________'} to be held and disbursed for the Tenant damages to the Leased Property or other defaults under this Lease (if any) as provided by law.

(2) However, the money may be applied to the payment of accrued unpaid Rent and any damages which the Landlord has suffered by reason of the Tenant's non-compliance with the Lease, all as itemized by the Landlord in a written notice delivered to the Tenant, together with the remainder of the amount due sixty (60) days after termination of the tenancy and delivery of possession by the Tenant.
(b)(1) The Landlord shall be deemed to have complied with subsection (a) of this section by mailing via first class mail the written notice and any payment required to the last known address of the Tenant.
(2) If the letter containing the payment is returned to the Landlord and if the Landlord is unable to locate the Tenant after reasonable effort, then the payment shall become the property of the Landlord one hundred eighty (180) days from the date the payment was mailed.

Default.
The Tenant will be in default of this Lease if the Tenant fails to comply with any material provisions of this Lease by which the Tenant is bound. Subject to any governing provisions of law to the contrary, if the Tenant fails to cure any financial obligation (or any other obligation) after written notice of such default is provided by the Landlord to the Tenant, the Landlord may elect to cure such default and the cost of such action will be added to the Tenant's financial obligations under this Lease. All sums of money or charges required to be paid by the Tenant under this Lease will be additional rent, whether or not such sums or charges are designated as "additional rent." The rights provided by this Paragraph are cumulative in nature and are in addition to any other rights afforded by law.

Utilities.
The Tenant agrees to pay all charges for all utilities, including electricity, internet, cable, gas, water, garbage disposal, and telephones, used in or on the Leased Property during the term of this Lease. The Tenant shall make payments for these utilities directly to the utility companies. The Tenant also agrees to comply with any environmental, waste management, recycling, energy conservation, or water conservation programs implemented by the Landlord.

Separate Gas Meter.

The Tenant is required to obtain the Landlord's approval in writing before bringing pets onto the Leased Property or allowing pets to reside there.

(3) allow any person to use the Leased Property other than those uses specified in the Use of Leased Property Paragraph above.

The Tenant shall have the non-exclusive right to use the entrances, lobbies, accessways, hallways, stairways, elevators, sidewalks, driveways, parking areas, landscaped areas, and other areas of the Leased Property that are designated for the non-exclusive common use of the Tenant and their guests ("Common Areas").

The Landlord shall have the responsibility to maintain the Leased Property in reasonably good repair at all times and perform all repairs reasonably necessary to satisfy any implied warranty of habitability. Except in an emergency, the Tenant is hereby informed that any property maintenance issue, repair requests, or concerns should be reported to the Landlord at ${answers.landlord_phone || '________'} or ${answers.landlord_email || '________'}. A repair request will be deemed permission for entry into the Leased Property by the Landlord or their agents to perform such maintenance or repairs. The Tenant may not place any unreasonable restrictions upon the Landlord or the Landlord's agents' access or entry. The Landlord shall have the expectation that the Leased Property is in a safe and habitable condition upon entry.
The Tenant acknowledges that the Leased Property from time to time may require renovations or repairs to keep them in good condition and repair and that such work may result in temporary loss of use of portions of the Leased Property and may inconvenience the Tenant. The Tenant agrees that any such loss shall not constitute a reduction in housing services or otherwise warrant a reduction in Rent. Further, subject to local law, the Tenant agrees, upon request of the Landlord, to temporarily vacate the Leased Property for a reasonable period, to allow for fumigation (or other methods) to control wood-destroying pests or organisms, or other repairs to the Leased Property. The Tenant agrees to comply with all instructions and requirements necessary to prepare the Leased Property to accommodate pest control, fumigation or other work, including bagging or storage of food and medicine and removal of perishables and valuables. The Tenant shall only be entitled to a credit of rent equal to the per diem rent for the period of time the Tenant is required to vacate the Leased Property.
The Tenant further agrees to cooperate in any efforts undertaken by the Landlord to rid the Leased Property of pests of any kind. Failure of the Tenant to cooperate may be deemed an obstruction of the free use of property so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property thereby constituting a nuisance.
The Tenant shall properly use, operate, and safeguard the Leased Property, including if applicable, any landscaping, furniture, furnishings, and appliances, and all mechanical, electrical, gas, and plumbing fixtures, and keep them and the Leased Property clean, sanitary, and well ventilated.

As required by law, service animals are the only exception to this rule. If a pet has been in the Tenant's apartment, even temporarily, the Tenant may be charged for cleaning, de-fleaing, deodorizing, or shampooing any portion of the Leased Property at the discretion of the Landlord.

The Tenant shall also provide to the Landlord a copy of the official orders or a letter signed by the Tenant's commanding officer reflecting the change that warrants termination under this clause.

Severability.
If any portion of this Lease shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions shall continue to be valid and enforceable. If a court finds that any provision of this Lease is invalid or unenforceable, but that by limiting such provision it would become valid and enforceable, then such provision shall be deemed to be written, construed, and enforced as so limited. The failure of either party to enforce any provisions of this Lease shall not be construed as a waiver or limitation of that party's right to subsequently enforce and comply with strict compliance with every provision of this Lease.

Estoppel Certificate.
The Tenant shall execute and return a tenant estoppel certificate delivered to the Tenant by the Landlord or the Landlord's agent within 3 days after its receipt. Failure to comply with this requirement shall be deemed the Tenant's acknowledgment that the estoppel certificate is true and correct, and may be relied upon by a lender or purchaser.
