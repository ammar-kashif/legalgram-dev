      question: "What's the main difference between an LLC and a Corporation?",
      answer: "An LLC offers flexible management and pass-through taxation, meaning profits go directly to owners without corporate tax. A Corporation is more structured, better for raising investment, and may be taxed at both corporate and personal levels (double taxation)."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to officially start a business?",
      answer: "It usually takes anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, depending on your state's processing times and whether you file online or by mail. Using a filing service can speed up the process."
    },
    {
      question: "Are there any tax advantages to different business types?",
      answer: "Yes. LLCs and S-Corps can offer pass-through taxation, which avoids double tax. S-Corps may also reduce self-employment tax on some income. C-Corps, while subject to corporate tax, can deduct a wide range of business expenses."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to appoint a registered agent for my business?",
      answer: "Yes. Almost all states require a registered agentâ€”a person or service that can receive legal and official documents on behalf of your business during business hours."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the best structure if I want investors or plan to go public?",
      answer: "A C-Corporation is typically the best choice. It allows you to issue multiple classes of stock, attract venture capital, and is the only structure suitable for going public."
